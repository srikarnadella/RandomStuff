# RandomStuff
Just some random pieces of code I wrote

#Facial Recognition
Just some code of me messing around with Open CV and trying to learn how the library works. Currently, I have a file that detects faces on a live camera and a file that detects faces on images. My next step is to work on training a model based on a bunch of celebrities' faces and having it learn to identify the face with a name.

#Password Generator
Wrote a file that creates and stores randomly generated passwords on an excel spreadsheet.

#Internet Speed Tester
I like to keep eyes on my internet and keeping this available to test the internet speed rather than a random website which may be malicious made sense
